# ~~ryanfiller.com~~

~~This is my personal portfolio site and blog. It's way over engineered for just a blog that parses markdown files and serves images, but hey, I want to show off my ability to code, too.~~

## ~~Installing~~

~~Clone the repository~~

<pre>
<code>
<del>git clone git@github.com:ryanfiller/portfolio-gatsby-v2.git ryansite</del>
</pre>
</code>

~~This site uses [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to store images, so if you want those you'll also need to run~~

<pre>
<code>
<del>git lfs get</del>
</pre>
</code>

~~Install dependencies~~

<pre>
<code>
<del>cd ryansite</del>
<del>yarn install</del>
</pre>
</code>

## ~~I like Gatsby!~~

~~Navigate into this site‚Äôs directory and start it up.~~

<pre>
<code>
<del>gatsby develop</del>
</pre>
</code>

~~The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!~~

~~_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._~~

## ~~I like testing!~~

<!-- (This badge _probably_ isn't üíØ yet but I'm doing my best!) -->

~~This site uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with several accessibility extensions. To run basic tests~~

<pre>
<code>
<del>npm run test</del>
</pre>
</code>

~~See my testing setup [here](https://github.com/ryanfiller/portfolio-gatsby-v2/tree/master/cypress)~~

## ~~I like Netlify!~~

~~[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/60054267-354c-4772-8941-db16095fee82/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ryanfiller-gatsby/deploys)~~

~~I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting and [Netlify Large Media](https://www.netlify.com/products/large-media/) as my image transformer and CDN.~~

## ~~I like Your Privacy!~~
~~This site contains no invasive analtyics tracking. It uses  [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/) on the site to anonymously track how many server requests are made, and [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to see what browsers and screen sizes people are using.~~

## ~~Roadmap~~

~~See my planned features / known bugs [here](https://github.com/ryanfiller/portfolio-gatsby-v2/projects/1).~~
~~I also keep a pretty up to date change log [here](http://ryanfiller.com/changes)~~
