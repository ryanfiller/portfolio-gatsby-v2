A few months ago when I decided to start my website from scratch I decided I would also keep a detailed [changelog](/changes). This was meant to track the progression of my code, but also my thought process of *why* I was adding things.\
\
talk about why the changes page exists.

show current code, talk about role="switch"

details html element?

talk about how this requires structured data (maybe?)

react / aria labels
