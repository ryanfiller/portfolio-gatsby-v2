A few months ago when I decided to start my website from scratch I decided I would also keep a detailed [changelog](/changes). This was meant to track the progression of my code, but also my thought process of *why* I was adding things. The version names are completely arbitrary, but I thought it might be fun to name them after [giant robots from the Gudam UC timeline](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/RX-78_Gundam_Series) since in universe those follow some semblance of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), and I am also a huge dork.

Pretty soon this page got long, and I wanted to add a basic accordion feature to it - each change set would have a header and a summary, and the details of what was changed would be collapsable.



show current code, talk about role="switch"

details html element?

talk about how this requires structured data (maybe?)

react / aria labels
