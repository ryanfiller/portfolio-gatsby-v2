    Science Gothic is a very cool variable font, but it is over one megabyte in
    size. I am testing and comparing the most efficient ways to load and style
    custom web fonts.

> The Only Difference Between Screwing Around and Science Is Writing It Down

[Science Gothic](https://github.com/tphinney/science-gothic) is a [variable font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide). The problem is that the font is 1.2mb.

I will be using the [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) Firefox extension to check page speed, and taking the average of five results.

## Loading the font (with Gatsby)
