## I have made six new Gatsby sites in twelve months

I've set up quite a few new Gatsby sites over the last year, 

## Design stuff

### gatsby-plugin-layout

Gatsby v1 had a concept of "layouts", which were high level components that automatically wrapped each page. This default behavior was taken was in Gatsby v2, but their offical docs explain the situation pretty well. 

> In the original implementation, the layout component was wrapped around the outside of the page component. This meant that the layout component could manage things like transitions and persistent state without any special workarounds, because it never rerendered. In version 2, the layout component is no longer special, and itâ€™s included in every page that wants to display it. This means that it does rerender on every route change.

I like being able to do page transitions, and Gatsby generously provides the [gatsby-plugin-layout](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-layout/) to bring back this v1 functionality. Since this component automatically wraps every page, I've found that its also a good place to put other global things, like styles or some context providers.
