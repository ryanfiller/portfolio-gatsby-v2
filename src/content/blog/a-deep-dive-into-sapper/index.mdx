Svelte is a Javascript framework that has been interseting to me since seeing [Nate Clark](https://nateclark.io/) give a short talk on it at my [local meetup](https://memphiswebworkers.com/) last summer. I build a really basic color app ([demo](https://rgb-color-values.netlify.app/), [code](https://github.com/ryanfiller/rgb-color-values)) around the same time and haven't touched Svelte much since then. A lot has changed since then, both in the world and with the framework - [Svelte 3](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity) was released earlier this year - and I thought it was time to take another look at both Svelte its application framework, [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/).
